`React`, `Vite`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `API`.

## üí° Idea

Customized Meme Generator offers a simple and intuitive UI that allows users to generate a random meme with just a few clicks. By using the [Imgflip API](https://imgflip.com/api), the app is able to access a large collection of high-quality meme templates, ensuring that users will always have access to fresh and relevant content. 

Users can also add Top and Bottom text to the Memes & customize them!

## Motivation

My motivation was to **practice** creating responsive React App, working with side effects (API) and state. I was practicing different aspects of React Development along the way (Props vs State, Forms in React, Conditional Rendering, useEffect, State, Event Listeners) and decided to save the [**practice** folder](https://github.com/ayazhankadessova/customized-meme-generator/tree/main/practice) here as well :)

I used the [Imgflip API](https://imgflip.com/api), which uses a RESTful JSON interface with standard HTTP form urlencoded parameters for requests and JSON data for responses. 

I also tried to make my code clearn by: 

1. Making the state as an object and using the `event` parameter in the `handleChange` function to determine which property of the state object(Meme) to update.

2. When you put a fetch function in the top level of a React component, it can cause infinite re-rendering. To prevent this, I got the data and saved it into state instead of calling the fetch function directly.
